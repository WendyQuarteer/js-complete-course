# FIX IT
## EX 05
In this exercise we want every word in a title to start with a capital letter.
* Look at the error message in the dev tools and fix it.

* Look at the documentation of split(). 
split() splits a string into an array of substrings

* Look at the documentation of charAt().
charAt() returns the character at a specified position in a string. 0 is the first character.

* Look at the documentation of slice().
  slice() extracts a part of a string and returns the extracted part. word.slice(1) will return each word separately.

* Adjust the function to get the desired result
