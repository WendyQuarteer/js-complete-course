* Look at the documentation of the join() function. Explain how it is used here.

*[link](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_join)
The join() method creates and returns a new string by concatenating all of 
the elements in an array (or an array-like object), separated by commas 
or a specified separator string. If the array has only one item, 
then that item will be returned without using the separator.

join() -> separated with a ','
join(" and ") -> separated with 'space and space'
('') will stick them together
('-') will separate with '-'
etc.

The listed wrappedMovies elements join inside a new string and are 
wrapped again into an ordered list.
