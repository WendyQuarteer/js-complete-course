* Look at the documentation of the join() function. Explain how it is used here.

*[link](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_join)
The join() method creates and returns a new string by concatenating all of the elements in an 
array (or an array-like object), separated by commas or a specified separator string. If the 
array has only one item, then that item will be returned without using the separator.

join() -> separated with a ','
join(" and ") -> separated with 'space and space'
('') will stick them together
('-') will separate with '-'
etc.

Here the listed wrappedMovies elements join and are wrapped again into an ordered list.
