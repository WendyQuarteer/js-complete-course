* The for-loop is no longer present.
  What was it replaced with? How does this work?

For-loop is replaced with for-each() method
The forEach() method executes a provided function once for each array element

* What does the function 'parseTitle' do? 
  What parameter do we pass to this function?

Each array element will be converted (to lower case toLowerCase()) with constance: lowerTitle
next each of these will be wrapped individually as a list item.

* What does the function 'wrapWithTag' do?
  Why are the parameters placed between brackets?

wrapWithTag will the wrap the content between tagname (content = Lowertitle / tagname = li)

A parameter is information to be supplied to the command. Parameters are enclosed with 
less-than and greater-than symbols or angle brackets < >. Each valid parameter is described 
following the statement of syntax for the command. Parameters are required by the command 
unless enclosed in braces { }. Do not include the < > symbols in the code.
