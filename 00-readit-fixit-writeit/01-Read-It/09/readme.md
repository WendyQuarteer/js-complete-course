* Notice how the 2 map functions are attached to each other, this is called 'method chaining'

Function chaining is a pattern in JavaScript where multiple functions are called on the 
same object consecutively. Using the same object reference, multiple functions can be 
invoked. It increases the readability of the code and means less redundancy.

* What does the parseTitle function do exactly?

Titles will get lower cases.  If the title starts with 'the', in console will be written: 
Film met THE: title then the title will also be UPPER-CASED.

* Notice how all the code is in the shape of functions.
