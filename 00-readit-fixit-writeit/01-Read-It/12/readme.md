## EX 12
* Notice the difference with the previous exercise.

3 new arrays are created for each value of each element, 
these were separately wrapped in a list as 3 different arrays next to each other (+)
each list forms a new sting inside a ul list(=createList)

* Why is there no 'return' in the parseMovieData function?

*[link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/return)
This as an array function so return is not needed
