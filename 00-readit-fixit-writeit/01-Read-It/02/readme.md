Template literals are literals delimited with backtick (`) characters, allowing for multi-line strings, 
for string interpolation with embedded expressions, and for special constructs called tagged templates.

Template literals are sometimes informally called template strings, because they are used most commonly 
for string interpolation (to create strings by doing substitution of placeholders). However, a tagged 
template literal may not result in a string; it can be used with a custom tag function to perform 
whatever operations you want on the different parts of the template literal.
