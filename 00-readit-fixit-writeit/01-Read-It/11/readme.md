## EX 11
* What's the difference with the previous exercises? What are we dealing with here?

There are multiple values for each element

* Where exactly do we define to only render the title

map(movie) created a new array in which only the title gets lower case
map(title) then created a new array in which these are wrapped in a list
next the list forms a new string in ordered list/createList
